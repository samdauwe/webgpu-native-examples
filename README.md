# WebGPU Native Examples and Demos

[WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) is a new graphics and compute API designed by the [“GPU for the Web”](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/) W3C community group. It aims to provide modern features such as “GPU compute” as well as lower overhead access to GPU hardware and better, more predictable performance. WebGPU should work with existing platform APIs such as Direct3D 12 from Microsoft, Metal from Apple, and Vulkan from the Khronos Group. 

WebGPU is designed for the Web, used by JavaScript and WASM applications, and driven by the shared principles of Web APIs. However, it doesn’t have to be only for the Web though. Targeting WebGPU on native enables to write extremely portable and fairly performant graphics applications. The WebGPU API is beginner friendly, meaning that the API automates some of the aspects of low-level graphics APIs which have high complexity but low return on investment. It still has the core pieces of the next-gen APIs, such as command buffers, render passes, pipeline states and layouts. Because the complexity is reduced, users will be able to direct more focus towards writing efficiently application code.

From the very beginning, Google had both native and in-browser use of their implementation, which is now called [Dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn). Mozilla has a shared interest in allowing developers to target a shared “WebGPU on native” target instead of a concrete “Dawn” or “[wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native)”. This is achieved, by a [shared header](https://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers), and C-compatible libraries implementing it. However, this specification is still a moving target.

This repository contains a collection of open source C examples for [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) using [Dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn) the open-source and cross-platform implementation of the work-in-progress [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) standard.

## Examples

### Basics

#### [Clear screen](src/examples/clear_screen.c)

This example shows how to set up a swap chain and clearing the screen. The screen clearing animation shows a fade-in and fade-out effect.

#### [Coordinate system](src/examples/coordinate_system.c)

Illustrates the coordinate systems used in WebGPU. WebGPU’s coordinate systems match DirectX and Metal’s coordinate systems in a graphics pipeline. Y-axis is up in normalized device coordinate (NDC): point(-1.0, -1.0) in NDC is located at the bottom-left corner of NDC. This example has several options for changing relevant pipeline state, and displaying meshes with WebGPU or Vulkan style coordinates.

Render | Depth | Texture

#### [Minimal](src/examples/minimal.c)

Minimalistic render pipeline demonstrating how to render a full-screen colored quad.

#### [Square](src/examples/square.c)

This example shows how to render a static colored square in WebGPU with only using vertex buffers.

#### [Triangle](src/examples/triangle.c)

Basic and verbose example for getting a colored triangle rendered to the screen using WebGPU. This is meant as a starting point for learning WebGPU from the ground up.

#### [Two cubes](src/examples/two_cubes.c)

This example shows some of the alignment requirements involved when updating and binding multiple slices of a uniform buffer.

#### [Points](src/examples/points.c)

This example shows how to render points of various sizes using a quad and instancing. You can read more details [here](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-points.html).

#### [Cameras](src/examples/cameras.c)

This example provides example camera implementations

#### [Bind groups](src/examples/bind_groups.c)

Bind groups are used to pass data to shader binding points. This example sets up bind groups & layouts, creates a single render pipeline based on the bind group layout and renders multiple objects with different bind groups.

#### [Dynamic uniform buffers](src/examples/dynamic_uniform_buffer.c)

Dynamic uniform buffers are used for rendering multiple objects with multiple matrices stored in a single uniform buffer object. Individual matrices are dynamically addressed upon bind group binding time, minimizing the number of required bind groups.

#### [Texture mapping](src/examples/textured_quad.c)

Loads a 2D texture from disk (including all mip levels), uses staging to upload it into video memory and samples from it using combined image samplers.

#### [Textured cube](src/examples/textured_cube.c)

This example shows how to bind and sample textures.

#### [Cubemap texture](src/examples/cubemap.c)

This example shows how to render and sample from a cubemap texture.

#### [Cubemap textures](src/examples/texture_cubemap.c)

Loads a cube map texture from disk containing six different faces. All faces and mip levels are uploaded into video memory, and the cubemap is displayed on a skybox as a backdrop and on a 3D model as a reflection.

#### [3D textures](src/examples/texture_3d.c)

Generates a 3D texture on the cpu (using perlin noise), uploads it to the device and samples it to render an animation. 3D textures store volumetric data and interpolate in all three dimensions.

#### [Volume Rendering - Texture 3D](src/examples/volume_rendering_texture_3d.c)

This example shows how to render volumes with WebGPU using a 3D texture. It demonstrates simple direct volume rendering for photometric content through ray marching in a fragment shader, where a full-screen triangle determines the color from ray start and step size values as set in the vertex shader. This implementation employs data from the BrainWeb Simulated Brain Database, with decompression streams, to save disk space and network traffic.

The original raw data is generated using [the BrainWeb Simulated Brain Database](https://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/) before processing in [a custom Python script](https://github.com/webgpu/webgpu-samples/tree/main/public/assets/img/volume/t1_icbm_normal_1mm_pn0_rf0.py).

#### [Equirectangular panorama](src/examples/equirectangular_image.c)

This example shows how to render an equirectangular panorama consisting of a single rectangular image. The equirectangular input can be used for a 360 degrees viewing experience to achieve more realistic surroundings and convincing real-time effects.

#### [Basis Universal texture loading](src/examples/basisu.c)

This example shows how to how to load [Basis Universal](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal) supercompressed GPU textures in a WebGPU application.

#### [A-Buffer](src/examples/a_buffer.c)

This example demonstrates order independent transparency using a per-pixel linked-list of translucent fragments.

#### [Reversed Z](src/examples/reversed_z.c)

This example shows the use of reversed z technique for better utilization of depth buffer precision. The left column uses regular method, while the right one uses reversed z technique. Both are using depth32float as their depth buffer format. A set of red and green planes are positioned very close to each other. Higher sets are placed further from camera (and are scaled for better visual purpose). To use  reversed z to render your scene, you will need depth store value to be 0.0, depth compare function to be greater, and remap depth range by multiplying an additional matrix to your projection matrix.

#### [Sampler Parameters](src/examples/sampler_parameters.c)

Visualizes what all the sampler parameters do. Shows a textured plane at various scales (rotated, head-on, in perspective, and in vanishing perspective). The bottom-right view shows the raw contents of the 4 mipmap levels of the test texture (16x16, 8x8, 4x4, and 2x2).

#### [Conservative rasterization](src/examples/conservative_raster.c)

This example shows how to render with conservative rasterization (native extension with limited support).

When enabled, any pixel touched by a triangle primitive is rasterized. This is useful for various advanced techniques, most prominently for implementing realtime voxelization.

The demonstration here is implemented by rendering a triangle to a low-resolution target and then upscaling it with nearest-neighbor filtering. The outlines of the triangle are then rendered in the original solution, using the same vertex shader as the triangle. Pixels only drawn with conservative rasterization enabled are colored red.

Note: Conservative rasterization not supported in Google Dawn.

#### [Wireframe and Thick-Line Rendering](src/examples/wireframe_vertex_pulling.c)

This example shows how to render a single indexed triangle model as mesh, wireframe, or wireframe with thick lines, without the need to generate additional buffers for line rendering.

Uses <a href="https://xeolabs.com/pdfs/OpenGLInsights.pdf">vertex pulling</a> to let the vertex shader decide which vertices to load, which allows us to render indexed triangle meshes as wireframes or even thick-wireframes.

<ul>
    <li>
        A normal wireframe is obtained by drawing 3 lines (6 vertices) per triangle.
        The vertex shader then uses the index buffer to load the triangle vertices in the order in which we need them to draw lines.
    </li>
    <li>
        A thick wireframe is obtained by rendering each of the 3 lines of a triangle as a quad (comprising 2 triangles).
        For each triangle of the indexed model, we are drawing a total of 3 lines/quads = 6 triangles = 18 vertices.
        Each of these 18 vertices belongs to one of three lines, and each vertex shader invocation loads the start and end of the corresponding line. The line is then projected to screen space, and the orthogonal of the screen-space line direction is used to shift the vertices of each quad into the appropriate directions to obtain a thick line.
    </li>
</ul>

#### [Offscreen rendering](src/examples/offscreen_rendering.c)

Basic offscreen rendering in two passes. First pass renders the mirrored scene to a separate framebuffer with color and depth attachments, second pass samples from that color attachment for rendering a mirror surface.

#### [Out-of-bounds Viewport](src/examples/out_of_bounds_viewport.c)

WebGPU doesn't let you set the viewport’s values to be out-of-bounds. Therefore, the viewport’s values need to be clamped to the screen-size, which means the viewport values can’t be defined in a way that makes the viewport go off the screen. This example shows how to render a viewport out-of-bounds.

#### [Stencil buffer](src/examples/stencil_buffer.c)

Uses the stencil buffer and its compare functionality for rendering a 3D model with dynamic outlines.

### glTF

These samples show how implement different features of the [glTF 2.0 3D format](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) 3D transmission file format in detail.

#### [glTF model loading and rendering](src/examples/gltf_loading.c)

Shows how to load a complete scene from a [glTF 2.0](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) file. The structure of the glTF 2.0 scene is converted into the data structures required to render the scene with WebGPU.

#### [glTF scene rendering](src/examples/gltf_scene_rendering.c)

Renders a complete scene loaded from an [glTF 2.0](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) file. The sample uses the glTF model loading functions, and adds data structures, functions and shaders required to render a more complex scene using [Crytek's Sponza model](https://casual-effects.com/data/) with per-material pipelines and normal mapping.

### Advanced

#### [MSAA line](src/examples/msaa_line.c)

This example shows how to achieve [multisample anti-aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing)(MSAA) in WebGPU. The render pipeline is created with a sample count > 1. A new texture with a sample count > 1 is created and set as the color attachment instead of the swapchain. The swapchain is now specified as a resolve_target.

#### [Multi sampling](src/examples/multi_sampling.c)

Implements multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) using a renderpass with multisampled attachments that get resolved into the visible frame buffer.

#### [High dynamic range](src/examples/hdr.c)

Implements a high dynamic range rendering pipeline using 16/32 bit floating point precision for all internal formats, textures and calculations, including a bloom pass, manual exposure and tone mapping.

#### [Cube reflection](src/examples/cube_reflection.c)

This example shows how to create a basic reflection pipeline.

#### [Shadow mapping](src/examples/shadow_mapping.c)

This example shows how to sample from a depth texture to render shadows from a directional light source.

#### [Run-time mip-map generation](src/examples/texture_mipmap_gen.c)

Generating a complete mip-chain at runtime instead of loading it from a file, by blitting from one mip level, starting with the actual texture image, down to the next smaller size until the lower 1x1 pixel end of the mip chain.

#### [Capturing screenshots](src/examples/screenshot.c)

This example shows how to capture an image by rendering a scene to a texture, copying the texture to a buffer, and retrieving the image from the buffer so that it can be stored into a png image. Two render pipelines are used in this example: one for rendering the scene in a window and another pipeline for offscreen rendering. Note that a single offscreen render pipeline would be sufficient for "taking a screenshot," with the added benefit that this method would not require a window to be created.

### Performance

#### [Instancing](src/examples/instanced_cube.c)

Uses the instancing feature for rendering (many) instances of the same mesh from a single vertex buffer with variable parameters.

#### [Occlusion queries](src/examples/occlusion_query.c)

This example demonstrates using Occlusion Queries.

#### [Render bundles](src/examples/render_bundles.c)

This example shows how to use render bundles. It renders a large number of meshes individually as a proxy for a more complex scene in order to demonstrate the reduction in time spent to issue render commands. (Typically a scene like this would make use of instancing to reduce draw overhead.)

### Physically Based Rendering

Physical based rendering as a lighting technique that achieves a more realistic and dynamic look by applying approximations of bidirectional reflectance distribution functions based on measured real-world material parameters and environment lighting.

#### [PBR basics](src/examples/pbr_basic.c)

Demonstrates a basic specular BRDF implementation with solid materials and fixed light sources on a grid of objects with varying material parameters, demonstrating how metallic reflectance and surface roughness affect the appearance of pbr lit objects.

#### [PBR image based lighting](src/examples/pbr_ibl.c)

Adds image based lighting from an hdr environment cubemap to the PBR equation, using the surrounding environment as the light source. This adds an even more realistic look the scene as the light contribution used by the materials is now controlled by the environment. Also shows how to generate the BRDF 2D-LUT and irradiance and filtered cube maps from the environment map.

#### [Textured PBR with IBL](src/examples/pbr_texture.c)

Renders a model specially crafted for a metallic-roughness PBR workflow with textures defining material parameters for the PRB equation (albedo, metallic, roughness, baked ambient occlusion, normal maps) in an image based lighting environment.

### Deferred

These examples use a [deferred shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading) setup.

#### [Deferred rendering basics](src/examples/deferred_rendering.c)

This example shows how to do deferred rendering with webgpu. Render geometry info to multiple targets in the gBuffers in the first pass. In this sample we have 2 gBuffers for normals and albedo, along with a depth texture. And then do the lighting in a second pass with per fragment data read from gBuffers so it's independent of scene complexity. World-space positions are reconstructed from the depth texture and camera matrix. We also update light position in a compute shader, where further operations like tile/cluster culling could happen. The debug view shows the depth buffer on the left (flipped and scaled a bit to make it more visible), the normal G buffer in the middle, and the albedo G-buffer on the right side of the screen.

### Compute Shader
